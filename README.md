# autoTrackerV2-old-version-
This is an old version of autoTracker from Winslow. The reason I keep this old version for the moment is because of compatibility with the scripts I added at that time, since compatibility of newer autoTracker versions did not check for compatibility with the scripts written by me.

The scripts written by me are: initializeOpto, displayOpto, optoYmaze, optoArena, getStimTargets. I eventually made also slight changes in other scripts.
